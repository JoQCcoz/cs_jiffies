# cs_jiffies
A personal respository for short scripts to do things in CryoSPARC

# Usage:
## Dependencies:
* cryosparc-tools
* jupyter notebook

## Instructions:
For Jupyter Notebooks files (files ending in `.ipnyb`, in a Python environment with cryosparc-tools and Jupyter Notebooks installed, open a new Jupyter notebook instance with `jupyter notebook`. Load the `.ipnyb` file in the Jupyter notebook, and follow the prompts from top to bottom.

For Python scripts (files ending in `.py`), typically make sure you have cryosparc-tools available (if using conda, load the conda environment), place a copy of the `.py` file where the data is you want to operate on, and run it from there.

You will need to be on a filesystem that has access to the data at the same path as CryoSPARC.
